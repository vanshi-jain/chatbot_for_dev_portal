# Incident Management - Identification and Logging Sequence

## Sequential Process Flow

1. Incident Initiation
   * Event: Initial incident occurs or is reported
   * Actor: Incident Manager
   * Action: Receives initial incident notification

2. Incident Identification and Logging
   * Event: Incident is formally identified and logged into system
   * Actor: Event Management/Service Desk
   * Action: Creates incident record and documents initial details

3. Configuration Item Search
   * Event: CMDB is searched for impacted Configuration Items
   * Actor: Service Desk Analyst
   * Action: Searches Configuration Management Database to identify affected CIs

4. Configuration Item Assessment
   * Event: Decision point - CI Found?
   * Actor: Service Desk Analyst
   * Action: Evaluates search results to determine if relevant CI is identified
   * Outcomes:
     - If YES → Proceed to CI Assessment
     - If NO → Proceed to Incident Analyst Assignment

5. Configuration Item Evaluation (Found Path)
   * Event: Configuration Item is assessed for impact
   * Actor: Service Desk Analyst
   * Action: Analyzes the identified CI and its potential impact

6. Service Specialist Notification
   * Event: Service specialist is alerted about the incident
   * Actor: Service Desk Analyst
   * Action: Notifies appropriate service specialist about the CI-related incident

7. Incident Analyst Assignment (No CI Found Path)
   * Event: Incident analyst is assigned to handle the case
   * Actor: Service Desk Analyst
   * Action: Assigns incident to available incident analyst for further investigation

8. Process Continuation
   * Event: Process continues to next phase (2.1)
   * Actor: System/Incident Manager
   * Action: Transitions to subsequent incident management phase

## Key Process Characteristics

- Primary Actors: Incident Manager (oversight), Event Management/Service Desk (logging), Service Desk Analyst (analysis and routing)
- Critical Decision Point: CI identification determines the routing path for incident handling
- Dual Routing: Process splits based on whether Configuration Item is found or not
- CMDB Integration: Heavy reliance on Configuration Management Database for impact assessment
- Specialist Escalation: CI-related incidents are routed to specialized resources
- Process Flow: This represents Phase 1.0 with continuation to Phase 2.1
