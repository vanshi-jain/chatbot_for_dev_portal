# File Processing Workflow - Sequence of Events

## Sequential Process Flow

1. Process Initiation
   * Event: File processing workflow begins
   * Actor: Partner
   * Action: Starts the file submission process

2. Data File Submission
   * Event: Data files are submitted for processing
   * Actor: Partner
   * Action: Submits data files to the FTP server

3. File Receipt
   * Event: Files are received on FTP server
   * Actor: FTP Server
   * Action: Receives and stores submitted files

4. Scheduled Processing Trigger
   * Event: Automated processing schedule activates
   * Actor: Straight-through Processing System
   * Action: Triggers processing at scheduled times (4:00, 7:00 & 13:00)
   * Note: Should probably be event-based, triggered when file arrives

5. File Transfer to Working Directory
   * Event: Files are moved to processing location
   * Actor: Straight-through Processing System
   * Action: Moves files from FTP location to working directory

6. File Trigger Activation
   * Event: File processing trigger is activated
   * Actor: Straight-through Processing System
   * Action: Initiates file processing sequence

7. File Processing Execution
   * Event: Files are processed according to business rules
   * Actor: Straight-through Processing System
   * Action: Processes files and validates data

8. Processing Success Evaluation
   * Event: Decision point - Processing successful?
   * Actor: Straight-through Processing System
   * Action: Evaluates processing results
   * Outcomes:
     - If YES → Proceed to Data Storage
     - If NO → Proceed to Rejection Processing

9. Data Storage (Success Path)
   * Event: Processed data is stored in system
   * Actor: System of Record
   * Action: Stores validated data in database

10. Confirmation Processing
    * Event: Processing confirmation is generated
    * Actor: FTP Server
    * Action: Creates confirmation record for successful processing

11. Confirmation Notification
    * Event: Partner is notified of successful processing
    * Actor: Partner
    * Action: Receives confirmation via email notification

12. Rejection Processing (Error Path)
    * Event: Processing rejection is handled
    * Actor: FTP Server
    * Action: Creates rejection record for failed processing

13. Rejection Notification
    * Event: Partner is notified of processing failure
    * Actor: Partner
    * Action: Receives rejection notification via email

## Key Process Characteristics

- Primary Actors: Partner (initiates), Straight-through Processing System (executes), FTP Server (manages), System of Record (stores)
- Scheduling: Automated processing at 4:00, 7:00, and 13:00 (recommendation to make event-based)
- Decision Point: Success/failure evaluation determines notification path
- Dual Outcomes: Success leads to data storage and confirmation; failure leads to rejection notification
- Notification System: Email-based communication for both success and failure scenarios
