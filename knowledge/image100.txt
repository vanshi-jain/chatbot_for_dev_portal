# Software Development - Sequence of Events

## Sequential Process Flow

1. Development Process Initiation
   * Event: Software development process begins
   * Actor: Software Development Team
   * Action: Initiates the development workflow

2. Requirements Documentation Receipt
   * Event: Requirements document is received for requested features
   * Actor: Software Design Team
   * Action: Receives and reviews requirements documentation from stakeholders

3. Specification Development
   * Event: Specifications are developed to meet requirements
   * Actor: Software Design Team
   * Action: Creates detailed specifications based on received requirements

4. Internal Design Development
   * Event: Internal design is developed to meet specifications
   * Actor: Software Design Team
   * Action: Creates internal system design architecture

5. External Design Development
   * Event: External design for user interface is developed
   * Actor: Software Design Team
   * Action: Designs user interface and external system interactions

6. Design Impact Assessment
   * Event: Decision point - Does external design necessitate change in internal design?
   * Actor: Software Design Team
   * Action: Evaluates if external design requires internal design modifications
   * Outcomes:
     - If NO → Proceed to Programming Time Scheduling
     - If YES → Return to Internal Design Development (creates design iteration loop)

7. Programming Time Scheduling
   * Event: Programming time is scheduled for development work
   * Actor: Software Development Team
   * Action: Schedules development resources and timeline

8. Code Development
   * Event: Code is written based on approved designs
   * Actor: Software Coding Team
   * Action: Implements code according to design specifications

9. Testing Plan Creation
   * Event: Code testing plan is written
   * Actor: Software Coding Team
   * Action: Develops comprehensive testing strategy and test cases

10. Quality Assurance Testing
    * Event: Application undergoes QA testing
    * Actor: Software Coding Team
    * Action: Executes testing plan and validates application functionality

11. Bug Detection Assessment
    * Event: Decision point - Bugs found during testing?
    * Actor: Software Coding Team
    * Action: Evaluates testing results for defects
    * Outcomes:
      - If NO → Proceed to Release Preparation
      - If YES → Return to Code Development (creates bug fix iteration loop)

12. Release Preparation
    * Event: Application is prepared for future build release
    * Actor: Software Development Team
    * Action: Finalizes application for deployment and release

## Key Process Characteristics

- Primary Actors: Software Development Team (coordination), Software Design Team (architecture), Software Coding Team (implementation)
- Two Critical Decision Points: 
  - Design compatibility assessment (creates design iteration loop)
  - Bug detection evaluation (creates development iteration loop)
- Iterative Loops: Process includes two potential feedback loops for design refinement and bug fixing
- Cross-functional Flow: Process spans multiple specialized teams with handoffs
- Quality Gates: Multiple quality control points ensure final product meets requirements
- Linear Progression: Despite loops, overall flow progresses from requirements through release
